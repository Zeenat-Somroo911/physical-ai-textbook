# Projects Overview

Welcome to the Projects section! Here you'll find hands-on projects that integrate concepts from all modules to build complete robotics systems.

## Project Structure

Each project includes:
- **Objective**: What you'll build
- **Prerequisites**: Required knowledge
- **Step-by-step Guide**: Detailed instructions
- **Code Examples**: Complete implementations
- **Testing**: How to validate your work
- **Extensions**: Ideas for further development

## Available Projects

### Project 1: Basic Robot with ROS2

Build a simple mobile robot controlled via ROS2, learning fundamental concepts of robot communication and control.

**Skills**: ROS2 nodes, topics, basic control

### Project 2: Simulation Setup

Create a complete simulation environment in Gazebo with a robot, sensors, and a custom world.

**Skills**: Gazebo, URDF, simulation, sensors

### Project 3: VLA Integration

Implement a Vision-Language-Action system that enables a robot to follow natural language instructions.

**Skills**: VLA models, multimodal learning, ROS2 integration

## Getting Started

1. Review the project requirements
2. Set up your development environment
3. Follow the step-by-step guide
4. Test and iterate
5. Explore extensions

## Project Guidelines

- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic functionality

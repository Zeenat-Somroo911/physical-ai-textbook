# Module 2: Simulation & Gazebo

Welcome to Module 2! This module covers robot simulation using Gazebo, one of the most popular physics simulators for robotics.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the fundamentals of robot simulation
- Create and configure robot models in Gazebo
- Work with sensors and actuators in simulation
- Understand physics engines and their parameters
- Build realistic simulation environments
- Apply advanced simulation techniques

## Module Structure

This module consists of 6 chapters:

1. **Gazebo Basics** - Introduction to Gazebo and its architecture
2. **Robot Models** - Creating URDF and SDF robot descriptions
3. **Sensors and Actuators** - Configuring and using simulated sensors
4. **Physics Engines** - Understanding and tuning physics parameters
5. **Environments** - Building worlds and scenarios
6. **Advanced Simulation** - Optimization, plugins, and integration

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Module 1 (ROS2 Fundamentals)
- Basic understanding of 3D modeling concepts
- Familiarity with XML/URDF syntax

Let's dive into the world of robot simulation!

# Module 3: AI-Powered Perception

Welcome to Module 3! This module covers **FREE** AI-powered perception tools for robotics. All tools work on normal laptops without expensive hardware.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand free alternatives to expensive tools
- Use PyBullet for physics simulation
- Process images with OpenCV
- Build maps with ORB-SLAM3
- Navigate with Nav2
- Integrate complete perception pipelines

## Module Structure

This module consists of 6 chapters:

1. **Free Alternatives** - Why free tools and comparison
2. **PyBullet Basics** - Free physics simulation
3. **Computer Vision** - OpenCV for robotics
4. **SLAM Basics** - ORB-SLAM3 and RTAB-Map
5. **Navigation** - Nav2 stack
6. **Perception Pipeline** - Complete system integration

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Module 1 (ROS2 Fundamentals)
- Completion of Module 2 (Simulation & Gazebo)
- Basic understanding of Python
- **No expensive hardware required!**

## All Tools Are FREE

This module focuses entirely on **FREE** tools:
- ✅ PyBullet: Free physics simulation
- ✅ OpenCV: Free computer vision
- ✅ ORB-SLAM3: Free SLAM system

# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

A comprehensive digital textbook project for Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics, featuring interactive content, code examples, and an AI-powered chatbot assistant.

## Project Overview

This project is designed as a collaborative hackathon effort to create an educational resource covering:

- **Physical AI**: The intersection of artificial intelligence and physical systems
- **Humanoid Robotics**: Design, control, and applications of humanoid robots
- **Interactive Learning**: Code examples, simulations, and hands-on exercises
- **AI Assistant**: Intelligent chatbot to help students learn and explore concepts
